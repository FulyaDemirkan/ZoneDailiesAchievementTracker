## Description

  

Are you working on your daily achievements but got lost on which ones you still need? Are you tired of scrolling through endless in game achievement screens?

If so, this addon is for you!

With this addon you can see the status of all the daily achivements that have three tiers in one place.

Also,

- You can check the details of the achievement by clicking on the icon,

- Teleport to the location of the quest giver by clicking on the zone name,

- or see the remaining number of quests required by hovering over the achievement name.


New feature is here! Now you can see if any quest for that achievement is completed for the day. Please beware, this feature will only work for the quests accepted after the addon update.

You can open the addon by using /zdat command or binding a key.
